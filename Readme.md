##Fire Rescue Response Time Analysis
The project aims at finding the *fire rescue response* time for a city. We have developed an framework for the this and tested it on
the city of London. This framework can also be used for finding if the city is well protected or not and identify areas which are 
vulnerable. 

The Four Models developed are
1 Euclidean Model
2 Connectivity Model
3 Traffic Model
4 Population Model

The simulations were done on QGIS, an open-source software from OSGeo.
